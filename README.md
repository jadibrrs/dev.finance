It is great to have you here. I hope you are going to enjoy this project.

## Introduction

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project. Run `npm init -y`.

It is also required to install Cypress. Run `npm install cypress@13.7.3 --save-dev` (or any later version).
